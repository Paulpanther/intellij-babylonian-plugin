# Intellij Plugin for Live Programming
<!-- Plugin description -->
This project shows how Babylonian graphical concepts and features like seen in Babylonian/S can be translated into common IDEs.
The plugin implements examples and probes for JavaScript.
The GraalVM Extension is a fork of [polyglot-live-programming](https://github.com/hpi-swa/polyglot-live-programming)
<!-- Plugin description end -->

**It is still a prototype and not usable for actual programming.**
